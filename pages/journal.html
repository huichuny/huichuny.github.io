    <p>After reading Daniel’s dissertation, I realize instrument making is a way of erasing, gapping, carving, cutting, subtractive ways of thinking. The idea of cutting through the body for air to go through and resonate with both, speaks to my art practice of using breath that resonates with material inside the mouth and throughout the body. It also resonates with how I see myself as an Asian in noise music. I feel like I’m cutting through the land being a foreigner and finding voice and sound and community and medium that vibrate between me and the environment. Cutting the wood is to create the in-between spaces, is to add the possibility of vibration and resonance. Bringing the technology into nature is also to create the in-between spaces, to grow the computer inside soil, and to vibrate the tree and grass and water with electronic sound.  </p>

    <p>I have been working on solar sounder project since last month. Femi taught me how to do the paper circuit by Peter Blasser. This is the first time that I really feel soldering itself can be an art piece that holds messages and thoughts. It made me start to think of my relatiobship with all these electronics in a different ways. How do they wanna be? What kind of body they like? How much my SELF should be attached on it? And then I made a 2*2 cm mini sculpture out of solder wire cause I got bored. </p>

    <p>Today is the last day before I head back to Providence, my sweet home. I've been in New York since August 19th, 11 days. I was meeting with a lot of sound friends this past few days. I met DC & 政憲 at BAS. They are music friends from Taiwan, and it felt so special and sweet to spend night with them. I met with Maralie. It made me happy to just talking to her like friend and sharing things. I met Emad. We've been following each other for a while on instagram and finally met each other in NY. We had a really good conversation about our art practice, life, struggle, and happiness. I gave Emad a hug before we say goodbye. I met Dan. We know each other on my Contact Improv Jam last time. Ching-I connect us. Dan treat me very well with delicious food, and we look at each other's computer, patches, and files. We then jam a lil bit, I played his cello, and he was on the supercollider doing live coding for my sound. We recorded it and play it after the CI JAM on the street. I love it. <be> About the CI Jam, it's a whole new experience for me. I've never experience that the body and fall in love with each other by just contacting. I've never get that close with any human beings, not even my partner or parents. It's a different distance of closeness and contact. You feel the sweat, the breath, the shaking of body, the light on their skin, the end of their finger tips. We can move in anyways and anywhere by just contacting and feeling the body. We can form so many different worlds by wading through the fog and water and swamp (different people gives you different feelings of worlds). I appreciate that I have this body and I appreciate yours too. <br> I also went to a gallery opening for paintings at Bushwick. I realize for me seeing a painting is eating food, and painting is cooking. You see different light, color, texture, shadow with different distance. You experience different smells when looking at, smelling, chewing it. It's always changing and can never being capture. Digital art on screen is different. You get close to the screen and you see the pixel, the technology, the medium, the 0 and 1 bit that made up the illusion. But painting, you see more worlds when getting close. You see time, effort, history, story, spaces, and sometimes yourself. <br> It might be the most beautiful visiting of NY ever. </p>

    <p>I was working with Daniel since the past few days, helping with sanding and oiling the dax, in exchange for having my own daxophone. It is also hanging out with Daniel that I know the word "creative capitalism". It's nice that artist found a way to wade and create path through this swamp of capitalism.</p>

    <p> Non-Event @ First Church in Jamaica Plain, May 16 2025. i have to say i am so lucky that my set at pity polar with femi was seen by Chris, so that i was invited to play a Non-Event series, and got the chance to meet Laura Cocks, who is the most amazing flutist i've ever heard. i can never forget that Laura said to me: we address our breath in different ways...balloon is like a geographical site that you give access to people to witness your struggle and vulnerability....and we both stopped talking because we're gonna cry. it was a beautiful night.</p>

    <p> Residual Noise @ RISD SRST, April 5 2025. i played balloon with 29 channels ambisonic deme shpae speaker arrays at RISD's Studio for Research in Sound and Technology. the sound in the space, or the space shaped by the sound is so alive, all of the movement is right here. sometimes you can not ignore the power of good quality technology supported by academia that are sometime not align with the idea of diy community. i think it is nice to be in both group and be in the in-between.</p>

    <p> orea cookie therapy performed at pity parlor.  This show was the beginning. It was my first duo set with Femi, my first time performing in a noise venue in Boston. That night led to an invitation from Chris
Strunk to play a Non-Event show. None of this would have happened without another balloon vibrating beside me, and without a space that brings people together
(thank you Janet). Luck can’t explain everything—but I’m so lucky to have them around me. I also started learning to be confident and comfortable in noise and
improvisation aer playing with Femi. Just being aware of each gesture and staying in flow with sound is already a kind of miracle.</p>
