    <p>today i hang out with friends at ponyhenge. we bring acoustic and batteryed instruments and jam. my arbrasson was broken when we're playing. i'm a lil sad but also happy for it because it died at this adorable place and were surrounded by these people i love so much during sunset. thank you for playing some amazing shows with me. i'm gonna make a new one soon.</p>
