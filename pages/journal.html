    <p> Non-Event @ First Church in Jamaica Plain, May 16 2025. i have to say i am so lucky that my set at pity polar with femi was seen by Chris, so that i was invited to play a Non-Event series, and got the chance to meet Laura Cocks, who is the most amazing flutist i've ever heard. i can never forget that Laura said to me: we address our breath in different ways...balloon is like a geographical site that you give access to people to witness your struggle and vulnerability....and we both stopped talking because we're gonna cry. it was a beautiful night.</p>

    <p> Residual Noise @ RISD SRST, April 5 2025. i played balloon with 29 channels ambisonic deme shpae speaker arrays at RISD's Studio for Research in Sound and Technology. the sound in the space, or the space shaped by the sound is so alive, all of the movement is right here. sometimes you can not ignore the power of good quality technology supported by academia that are sometime not align with the idea of diy community. i think it is nice to be in both group and be in the in-between.</p>

    <p> orea cookie therapy performed at pity parlor.  This show was the beginning. It was my first duo set with Femi, my first time performing in a noise venue in Boston. That night led to an invitation from Chris
Strunk to play a Non-Event show. None of this would have happened without another balloon vibrating beside me, and without a space that brings people together
(thank you Janet). Luck can’t explain everything—but I’m so lucky to have them around me. I also started learning to be confident and comfortable in noise and
improvisation aer playing with Femi. Just being aware of each gesture and staying in flow with sound is already a kind of miracle.</p>
