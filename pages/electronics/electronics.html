    <p> I felt the rise and fall of my chest. I hear noise when I breath. I felt the pressure when I put pressure on the sensors.</p>

   <p>Touching and feeling the pressure helps my body feel grounded when performing with sensors. I want to make a midi that invites body gestures and forget the fact that it's just a digital mapping process. I was exploring the relationship between these electronics, my body, and the sound. Technology shouldn't be made to minimize human effort but to inspire us being aware of more unconscious gestures that introduce different knowledge of our body and ourselves.</p>

    <h2>Spatial audio could be portable, without perfect shape, without sweet spot. It realizes the sound sculptures of any shape and texture. </h2>

      <p>I made this speaker module when I was working on my thesis performance for my MFA degree in Digital Media at RISD. I want the balloon become a space that resonate with my breath, becoming a isolated sonic spaces that has its own sound and breathing pattern. I was lucky to help RISD SRST with the Wave Field Synthesis project and working closely with Stephen Cooke, so I learned how to build a speaker enclosure. The speaker was put inside a 3D printed body with a certain angle that fit to the edge of the balloon, so that the sound from the speaker could vibrate the latex the most. </p>

   <p>To observe the entanglement phenomenon, simply turn the control knob or place some psychedelic CV candy on Einstein’s tongue. Through the audio or CV output, you’ll experience the entangled world through Einstein’s eyes.

   <p>Inspired by the Gen patch made by Cycling ’74—the Lorenz attractor example that uses the history operator for chaotic functions—the system performs its work through recursive calculations. I replace the parameter inside the Gen patch with a control voltage that works in the Daisy Patch Submodule, a complete Eurorack module DSP engine. This synthesizer creates interesting waveforms that oscillate from high to low voltage, entangling with each other at every sample rate.</p>

  <h2>Project Detail</h2>
  <img src="pics/thesis/syn2.jpg" alt="modular synthesizer">
   <img src="pics/thesis/syn3.jpg" alt="modular synthesizer">
   <p> I took the RISD SRST course "Modular Synthesis Studio" taught by Alex Chechile. As described in the course syllabus, “In Modular Synthesis Studio, we will learn and apply concepts of voltage controlled synthesizers to creative coding and embedded computing platforms. Imbued with the spirit of community, together we will design and build a one-of-a-kind RISD modular synthesizer by semester end, while also creating new sound-based works with the system.”</p>
   <p>This project uses:
      <ul>
        <li>Daisy Patch Submodule</li>
        <li>Serge Module</li>
        <li>MaxMSP Gen</li>
      </ul>
