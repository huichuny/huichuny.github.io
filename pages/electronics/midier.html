	 <p>I was exploring the relationship between these electronics, my body, and the sound. I felt the rise and fall of my chest. I hear noise when I breath. I felt the pressure when I put pressure on the sensors.</p>

                <img src="pics/thesis/midi4.jpg" alt="diy midi controller">  <p>The pressure sensor can be too sensitive, so I hand sewed them on a piece of fabric and used Hook & Loop Fasteners to stick it with a yoga mat. </p>

        	 <img src="pics/thesis/midi0.jpg" alt="diy midi controller"> <p>The yoga mat cushions the pressure. However, I ended up not putting pressure sensors into yoga mat because I'm lazy. I also realize I can simply smooth out the immediate change of number in my Max patch.  </p>

         <h1>Touching and feeling the pressure helps my body feel grounded when performing with sensors. I want to make a midi that invites body gestures and forget the fact that it's just a digital mapping process.  </h1>

        </div>
        <p>I controlled the parameters in my Max patch intuitively through my feet on the midi. It invited my body to get close to the ground, focusing more on my relationship with the instrument I'm playing.</p>
