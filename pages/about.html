	<p>Huichun Yang is a Taiwanese sound artist, improviser, and composer based in Providence, Rhode Island. Her practice investigates the relationship between breath, body, and environment through spatial audio and electroacoustic performance. She works with mouth-resonated instruments such as balloons and mouth harps, as well as hand-built wooden instruments including the arbrasson and daxophone, alongside DIY electronics and computer-based sound programming. Her spatial sound environments explore thresholds, embodied gesture, and relational listening, reflecting on the in-between spaces of land, sound, water, culture, code, and vibration in air.<br><br>
  Huichun holds an MFA in Digital Media from the Rhode Island School of Design. Her work has been presented at ICMC (Boston, 2025), Non-event (Boston, 2025), Residual Noise (Providence, 2025), and SOUND/IMAGE Festival (London, 2024). She has led livecoding workshops at RISD and NYU ITP and is the recipient of the RISD Graduate Commons Grant Fellowship (2025).</p>
