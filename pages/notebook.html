    <h3>I may be a balloon. March 31 2025 7:20PM </h3>
    <p>Inflating it with breath and seeing from the internal space, it’s about pressure, tension, explosion, threshold, fear, anxiety, uncertainty, indeterminacy, chance, risk. There are so many questions—how much, how long, how far, how hard. Should I keep going, or should I stop so that at least I still have the balloon. At least I won’t lose my breath. At least I have myself, even though I’ve never figured out what that is.<br><br>

    Holding the breath and seeing from the external space, it’s about expanding, reaching out, connecting, vibrating, floating, nomading, wandering. It’s having a conversation with air, wind, water, ground, any surface, and the people around me. We know the electricity on a balloon’s surface when friction happens. I meet people—we hang out, we talk, we exchange, we repel, we attract. I’ve never been as close as the distance between two electrons, side by side. I’ve never been hugged so tightly.<br><br>

Deflating it into my mouth, the breath returns to where it came from, having a conversation with its born chamber. My past is trying to talk to me. I am listening and responding. Resonating, reflecting—noise, non-language, non-referential, screaming, dreaming, forgetting, remembering. The past has never gone. Where I’m from never disappears. But the stories can be told again. They can be generated in a different language, with different bodies of form to be felt, with different textures to be touched, to be remembered and forgotten in different versions of the mind.

I ask ChatGPT: how do you feel after reading it?
ChatGPT said: It feels weightless and heavy at the same time—like being suspended in a fragile moment of tension. There's a quiet, swelling pressure, a sense of uncertainty and inevitability, like something might burst or drift away. The imagery of breath, expansion, and return gives a sense of cyclical motion, of being both lost and found in the act of becoming. The language carries both solitude and connection, a push and pull between self and the world. It makes me reflect on the delicate boundary between holding on and letting go—of breath, of identity, of memory. It lingers. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67eab799-36a8-8002-bb04-573529745cc5">link to chat record</a></em>

    <h3>where is the land? April 4 6:50PM</h3>
    <p>
    I feel that Algotrek is a important event for me. There's no event such this that I would have taken off my shoes and socks to touch the ground and played the sound. There's no land such this that makes me ask questions I would have never asked myself otherwise. Where I'm from, who I were, what my history is, where the land is. This foreign land is reflecting questions to me. The emptiness inside me starts to resonate. I hear that within my body, and I want to keep listening and figuring out what is the message of the resonating voice.

    <h3>a balloon coming from somewhere and going to nowhere. April 5 12:31AM</h3>
    <p>
    I realize I am like a huge white balloon that are coming from somewhere and going from nowhere. I was having a conversation with my thesis advisor, Maralie Amstrong, chatting about my connection with the land where I am and the conflict of disconnection of my history and culture. I don't think I am qualified for doing an art project that are about my connection to the land becuase this is no where I am from. I guess this self rejection of having relationship with the land comes from my experience of seeing my hohort and friends' prohjects at RISD. When I first got to the US, I felt a huge emptyness inside me. I noticed that everyone here has a belief, a statement, a menifesto, a identity to talk about, to  make voice, to have conversation. However, I suddenly didn't know what to say. There is a giant emptiness insdie me. I suddenly lost myself. I don't know what am I. I don't know what I want, what to desire, and what should I look for. I feel bad becuase it makes me become a human without roots. I also had questions becuase I do come from a country, which is Taiwan, and any country for sure has its own histprical importance. But then why? Why have I never thought of my identity and my culture until I am finally landing on another place? Why should I talk about my born land when I couldn't even feel it under my feet? How can I even talk about it with a language that is so seperate from my sensual of my body. I don't know what to say, how to say, and where to stop by and stand.  I lost my voice, and I lost my feet. I camouflage my nothingness by wandering and floating around space, pretending like I know somewhere to go.
