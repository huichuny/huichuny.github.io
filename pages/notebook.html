    <h1>This is my notebook </h1>
    <h3>March 31 2025 7:20 PM. I may be a balloon.</h3>
    <p>Inflating it with breath and seeing from the internal space, it’s about pressure, tension, explosion, threshold, fear, anxiety, uncertainty, indeterminacy, chance, risk. There are so many questions—how much, how long, how far, how hard. Should I keep going, or should I stop so that at least I still have the balloon. At least I won’t lose my breath. At least I have myself, even though I’ve never figured out what that is.<br><br>

    Holding the breath and seeing from the external space, it’s about expanding, reaching out, connecting, vibrating, floating, nomading, wandering. It’s having a conversation with air, wind, water, ground, any surface, and the people around me. We know the electricity on a balloon’s surface when friction happens. I meet people—we hang out, we talk, we exchange, we repel, we attract. I’ve never been as close as the distance between two electrons, side by side. I’ve never been hugged so tightly.<br><br>

Deflating it into my mouth, the breath returns to where it came from, having a conversation with its born chamber. My past is trying to talk to me. I am listening and responding. Resonating, reflecting—noise, non-language, non-referential, screaming, dreaming, forgetting, remembering. The past has never gone. Where I’m from never disappears. But the stories can be told again. They can be generated in a different language, with different bodies of form to be felt, with different textures to be touched, to be remembered and forgotten in different versions of the mind.

I ask ChatGPT: how do you feel after reading it?
ChatGPT said: It feels weightless and heavy at the same time—like being suspended in a fragile moment of tension. There's a quiet, swelling pressure, a sense of uncertainty and inevitability, like something might burst or drift away. The imagery of breath, expansion, and return gives a sense of cyclical motion, of being both lost and found in the act of becoming. The language carries both solitude and connection, a push and pull between self and the world. It makes me reflect on the delicate boundary between holding on and letting go—of breath, of identity, of memory. It lingers. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67eab799-36a8-8002-bb04-573529745cc5"</a>link to chat record<em>
