   	<h2>oreo cookie therapy @ cat meow, July 17 2025</h2>
   	<p>femi and i played our arbrassons after I finishing making it. it sounded so good in the empty room with acoustic reflection that created nice reverb. and i especially love the moment that we both started walking while touching the arbrasson, feeling like we were rowing on a boat in the ocean.</p>

   	<h2>making an arbrasson</h2>
    <p>femi was teaching me making an arbrasson at new machine today. we started from drawing lines on a piece of wood, then use a wood saw to carve gaps, then smooth it out with sanding paper, then fine tune it with hand saw. it took only few hours to finish. </p>
