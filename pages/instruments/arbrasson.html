  <h1>Touching is a practice of grounding and breathing through pressure and sound. Arbrasson is a notched wooden instrument that resonates like a singing bird when its carved ridges are caressed. Through real-time computer processing, touch transforms into something spatial like fog, warm like a fire built from wood, and moist with memory like a flowing river.</h1>

    <h1>making an arbrasson</h1>
    <p>femi was teaching me making an arbrasson at new machine today. we started from drawing lines on a piece of wood, then use a wood saw to carve gaps, then smooth it out with sanding paper, then fine tune it with hand saw. it took only few hours to finish. </p>

    <p>oreo cookie therapy @ cat meow, July 17 2025. femi and i played our arbrassons after I finishing making it. it sounded so good in the empty room with acoustic reflection that created nice reverb. and i especially love the moment that we both started walking while touching the arbrasson, feeling like we were rowing on a boat in the ocean.</p>
