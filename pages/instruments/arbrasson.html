  <h1>Touching through a notched wood is a practice of grounding and breathing. Touch transforms air into sound that is spatial like a flowing river, warm in hand like a fire built from wood, and moist with memory like fog.</h1>

    <h1>Making an arbrasson</h1>
    <p>Arbrasson is a notched wooden instrument that resonates like a singing bird when its carved ridges are caressed. I learned making an arbrasson from Femi. I drew lines on a piece of wood, carved notch using wood saw, sanded it, then fine tune it with hand saw. </p>

  <h1> Improv with computer</h1>
  <p> I improvised with arbrasson, with gesture, pressure, sound, and space. Through the real-time computer processing in Max and with my DIY MIDI controller beneath my feet, the arbrasson sound transform into different levels of volume, texture, bodies, and spatial position. </p>

    <h1>Orea Cookie Therapy - Arbrasson Duo Set</h1>
    <p> Femi and I play our arbrasson with just acoustic. We played in an big empty warehouse with acoustic reflection that created long reverb. We both started walking while touching the arbrasson, feeling like we were rowing on a boat on the ocean.</p>
